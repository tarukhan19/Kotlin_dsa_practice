/*
Subsequence

A subsequence of a string is formed by deleting zero or more characters from the string without
changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
Example:
String = "abcde"
Subsequences include:

"abcde" (the whole string)

"ace" (deleted b and d)

"bd" (deleted a, c, e)

"" (empty string is always a subsequence)

ğŸ‘‰ Key: Order is preserved, but characters donâ€™t need to be consecutive.

s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
j runs from 0 â†’ 6 (length of t).
At most 6 iterations.

Each iteration = O(1) work.
So â†’ O(6) = O(|t|)

âœ… Final:
Loop runs at most |t| times.
Hence Time Complexity = O(|t|).
